* NB!: Read instructions/notes on printing and the description for the blank that you are planning to download!

## Motivation:
Good-looking printable blank staff/music paper is hard to come by. In this repository you will find blanks for a bunch of instruments and their combinations ***FOR FREE*** with no watermarks or other bs. Engraved beautifully with lilypond and available in both PDF and editable lilypond source files.

## Some notes before you download/clone:

		* I might make a letter paper branch for those of you who use that... possibly in the near future
